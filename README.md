# Lego-Dimensions-Partial-Shadow-Fix
An altered graphics pack initially made by bloodmc and Xalphenos, altered by me to restore shadows, even if they are broken. Please note this doesn't fix the shadows in the game, they are still broken, however I thought I would share this for people who don't mind and want a nicer looking game / experience.
