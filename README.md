# Lego-Dimensions-Partial-Shadow-Fix
An altered graphics pack initially made by bloodmc and Xalphenos, altered by me to restore shadows, even if they are broken. Please note this doesn't fix the shadows in the game, they are still broken, however I thought I would share this for people who don't mind and want a nicer looking game / experience.

Installation: Put within your graphics pack folder within the Cemu directory.

Usage: Enable the graphic pack within Cemu and set your desired resolution. Make sure you disable the old resolution pack.
